# Demian Lab

Demian is an experimental system: a discrete-time nonlinear recurrent
dynamical system with full state $z_t$, input $x_t$, and exposed readout $y_t$:

$
z_{t+1}=F(z_t,x_t), \qquad y_t=R(z_t).
$

The research hypothesis is separate from the system: an exposed recurrent
surface may converge while the full internal state retains structured,
continuation-relevant dynamics.

This repository contains experiments, controls, claims, figures, and papers.
Promoted runtime code belongs in Demian Substrate; superseded material belongs
in Demian Archive.

## Research Hierarchy

1. Classify surface dynamics from $y_t$.
2. Measure persistence and change in the full state $z_t$.
3. Test whether one surface class contains different internal regimes.
4. Trace source-to-target contributions through the six recurrent channels.
5. Compare full state with fixed-body `body_surface`; use fresh-body `surface_only` only as a package control.
6. Restore, intervene on, or ablate explicit routes and channels.
7. Couple declared observation/action interfaces to persistent external state.
8. Measure perturbation response and stability.
9. Characterize local dynamics with Jacobians or finite-time Lyapunov estimates.

AFP-v2 is the prospective scientific criterion: surface convergence
($\Delta y_t \to 0$) plus persistent structured hidden-state change after
excluding numerical drift, ordinary transients, and trivial accumulation.
Historical `accumulating_fixed_point` counts are AFP-v1 heuristic labels based
on maxima and contraction thresholds; they are not AFP-v2 confirmations.

The main target is whether projected fixed-point behavior coexists with
systematically different internal regimes, and whether those regimes align
with Demian's explicit recurrent channels.

## Experiment Timeline

| Stage | What was tested | What the data changed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Transformer self-loop | KV-cache and residual self-contact | Text quality stopped being the target; trajectory geometry became the target. |
| Transformer reservoir | Batch self-reference baseline | Saved runs showed a strong period-2 attractor signature. |
| Mamba reservoir | Same style of self-reference on an SSM | Mamba did not match the transformer 2-cycle; architecture changed the recurrence primitive. |
| Population pressure | Competition, continuity, inheritance-like survival | Continuity and memory survival became first-class measurements. |
| Plain recurrent baselines | Vanilla RNN, GRU, LSTM, diagonal SSM, selective SSM | The lab needed matched recurrent controls before claiming native-substrate effects. |
| GRU / dual-GRU lab | Message-state ablations and interior-class maps | Fixed point did not mean empty; basin interiors needed measurement. |
| Native v0-v7.4 | Explicit owners for persistence, support, recruitment, control, boundary, memory | Rich but too many mechanisms at once; simplification became necessary. |
| v8 / canonical v9 | Smaller native scaffolds and v9-v8 comparison | v9 was not proven better than v8; fixed-point surface behavior remained common. |
| v9 five-channel | `fast`, `slow`, `control`, `message`, `carrier` plus release probes | Message/carrier accumulation survived; sparse release-vector causality stayed weak. |
| v10.0 predecessor | Four-island frozen evolution | Selection found interesting sparse event/phase candidates, but held-out checks blocked a stable claim. |
| Track A / Track B | Engineered sparse release versus native emergence pressure | Forcing sparse release was less useful than discovering what the substrate naturally used. |
| Demian v1 | Explicit `gate` state added to the five-channel trail | Current synthesis point; contract-tested prototype, not yet a promoted empirical result. |

## What Has Evidence

| Finding | Evidence shape | Conservative read |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Transformer and Mamba self-loops differ | Reservoir summaries compare attractor signatures. | Recurrence behavior depends on architecture; do not assume one universal loop. |
| Plain recurrent baselines matter | Vanilla RNN, GRU, LSTM, diagonal SSM, and selective SSM run through the same self-loop battery. | Native results should be read against simpler recurrent controls, not in isolation. |
| Fixed point can hide internal structure | GRU/dual-GRU, v8/v9, and v9 five-channel diagnostics expose basin-internal differences. | A flat surface label is not enough to judge a substrate. |
| AFP-v2 rejects premature fixed-point claims | At 512 steps, none of nine baselines pass: canonical v9 settles or remains nonconvergent; five-channel remains nonconvergent; dual-GRU retains small-step drift. | AFP-v1 labels do not confirm AFP-v2. |
| v9 is not proven superior to v8 | Saved v9-v8 comparison: both fixed-point in 4/4 seeds; v9 had lower covariance rank and weaker scale-1.0 recovery in that run. | v9 remains a useful simplified scaffold, not a victory claim. |
| Continuation controls separate state from body | With model weights fixed, the representative `body_surface` arm diverges from full-state continuation; the `surface_only` arm also changes the body. | `body_surface` tests hidden-state relevance. `surface_only` tests the larger body-plus-state package and cannot isolate hidden-state causality. |
| v10.0 predecessor found but did not validate sparse release | 640 candidates across four islands; final winner had `duty=0.171875`, `event=0.7896`, `phase=0.9371`; held-out CPU checks weakened the claim. | Useful predecessor and falsification pressure, not a stable mechanism. |
| Track B points at structured channel anatomy | Message/carrier/control probes and null checks show real structure but also controls that prevent overclaiming. | Treat gate-state propagation as the current live hypothesis, not settled proof. |
| Route tracing is operational | Thirty implemented terms reconstruct all six target updates; tracing is trajectory-invariant. | The three-seed pilot validates measurement only. Route causality remains untested. |
| Closed-loop boundary is validated | Deterministic cue-delay-query world, bounded register, checkpoint/replay controls. | Interface validation only; no task ability or adaptive behavior claim. |
| Control helps capsule maintenance | Continuous control clamp degrades the capsule more than one-shot control zeroing. | Control is stabilizing; current data do not prove setpoints, selfhood, or narrative integration. |

## How To Read The Figures

The figures are diagnostic readouts, not decoration. Start with one question,
then open the relevant artifact:

| Question | Start here |
| --- | --- |
| Does internal state matter for resume? | [Capsule continuity](docs/CAPSULE_CONTINUITY.md) and [capsule figure](docs/assets/capsule_continuity_dark.svg) |
| What do the five channels do over time? | [v9 five-channel neuron overview](docs/assets/v9_5ch_neuron_activity_overview.svg) |
| Where are release events and candidate fronts? | [Machine visual artifact group](docs/assets/machine_visuals/) |
| What evidence is safe to cite? | [Claims Ledger](docs/CLAIMS.md) and [Artifact Index](data/INDEX.md) |

The front page intentionally does not embed every plot. Dense visual diagnostics
are useful after the reader knows what question they answer.

## Current Status

- This is an active research notebook, not a finished architecture announcement.
- Demian v1 is a prototype/design consequence of the lineage, not a completed
  empirical result.
- The strongest stable lesson is methodological: measure internal state,
  ablations, resumes, and held-out behavior before naming a mechanism.
- The current live target is to turn the message/carrier/control/gate-state
  evidence into matched route interventions and surface-matched comparisons.

## Repo Boundary

| Repo | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Demian Lab | Active experiments, diagnostics, claims, papers, and workbench code. |
| Demian Substrate | Stable runtime/package boundary for promoted Demian substrate code. |
| Demian Archive | Historical runtime, superseded notes, and preserved ancestry. |

Main local surfaces:

- `development/`: active research code and substrate workbench.
- `docs/`: claims, lineage, reproducibility, labbook, and publication surfaces.
- `data/`: indexed artifacts and summaries.
- `tests/`: active verification surface.

## Reproduce A Small Check

This CPU-only check compares canonical `demian_native_v9` against `demian_native_v8`
on one short seed. It is a smoke test and orientation path, not a full evidence
rerun:

```bash
./venv/bin/python -c "from development.substrates.current import compare_current_target; import json; r=compare_current_target(hidden_size=16, steps=16, perturb_step=8, seeds=[94], device='cpu'); print(json.dumps({'seeds': r['seeds'], 'mean_v9_recovery_1.0': r['aggregate'].get('mean_v9_recovery_1.0'), 'mean_v8_recovery_1.0': r['aggregate'].get('mean_v8_recovery_1.0')}, indent=2))"
```

Expected shape:

```json
{
  "seeds": [94],
  "mean_v9_recovery_1.0": 0.07895439697636498,
  "mean_v8_recovery_1.0": 0.04398368299007416
}
```

The exact values can move with runtime/library details; the public contract is
that the command runs and returns the listed keys.

For the current v9 five-channel / Demian v1 evidence path:

```bash
./venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_current_substrates.py tests/test_v9_5ch_summary.py -q
```

For the capsule-continuity side thread:

```bash
./venv/bin/python development/probe_v9_capsule_continuity.py --hidden-size 16 --pause-steps 24 --resume-steps 24 --seeds 94,95,96 --windows 16:16,24:24
./venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_v9_capsule_continuity.py -q
```

For the AFP-v2 characterization:

```bash
./venv/bin/python -m development.afp_v2_characterization --seeds 94,95,96 --hidden-size 16 --steps 512
./venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_afp_v2_characterization.py tests/test_v9_capsule_continuity.py -q
```

For route trajectories:

```bash
./venv/bin/python -m development.run_route_trajectory_pilot --seeds 94,95,96 --hidden-size 8 --steps 32
./venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_route_trajectory.py -q
```

For the deterministic closed-loop baseline:

```bash
./venv/bin/python -m development.run_closed_loop_baseline --seeds 94,95,96 --hidden-size 8 --steps 8
./venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_closed_loop_world.py tests/test_closed_loop_demian.py tests/test_closed_loop_baseline.py -q
```

## Environment

The local `venv` has the research runtime more reliably than the system interpreter.

Examples:

```bash
./venv/bin/ruff check development tests
./venv/bin/ruff format --check development/lab_schemas.py development/lab_tools.py development/validate_lab_artifact.py tests/test_lab_tooling.py
./venv/bin/python development/validate_lab_artifact.py data/evolution/v10_0_frozen_evolution_4island_20260510_summary.json
./venv/bin/python development/update_docs.py
./venv/bin/python development/run_substrate_tests.py
./venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_current_substrates.py
./venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_v9_5ch_evolution.py
./venv/bin/python development/summarize_v9_5ch_evolution.py data/evolution/v10_0_frozen_evolution_island_*_20260510 --experiment v10.0-frozen-evolution --eval-seed 94 --out /tmp/demian_v1_predecessor_summary.json
./venv/bin/python -c "from development.substrates.current import compare_current_target; import json; print(json.dumps(compare_current_target(seeds=[94], steps=64), indent=2))"
./venv/bin/python development/summarize_results.py
```

## Current Software Caveats

- This repo is an active lab, not a stabilized package.
- Some older tests and scripts still reflect pre-geometric `mode` terminology.
- Do not dismiss `FIXED_POINT` regimes as boring by default. Current v9 five-channel evidence shows `surface_fixed_accumulating` can coexist with internal richness and other bounded regimes.
- archived notes and plans are useful context, but they are not a substitute for checking raw artifacts.

The correct standard here is not product polish, benchmark wins, or human approval. It is clarity of structure, experimental traceability, and avoiding anthropocentric interpretation drift while isolating machine-useful principles.
